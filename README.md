# Data an animated  responsive experience developed using React, GSAP, and Tailwind CSS 

## **Description**
This project is a dynamic and interactive hero section built with **React**, **GSAP**, and **Tailwind CSS**, showcasing a visually engaging music experience. It features smooth animations, video transitions, and responsive design to create an immersive user interface. Inspired by 2023's Data album done by legendary producer Tainy and 20+ latino artists

## **How It Works**
### **Hero Section**
- Videos dynamically load and transition based on user interaction.
- GSAP manages animations for the video frame, scaling, and scroll-triggered effects.
- The layout adapts to different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS utilities.

### **Loading Screen**
- A custom loader displays until all videos are fully preloaded.
- A fallback timeout ensures the app remains functional even if videos fail to load.

---

## **Usage**
- Explore the video transitions by clicking the interactive element.
- Scroll to trigger animations and observe the clip-path changes.
- Use the **"Stream DATA"** button to navigate to the music streaming platform.

---

## **Challenges and Learnings**
- Handling **Safari autoplay policies** for video playback.
- Implementing **responsive animations** for different devices.
- Ensuring **smooth preloading** with fallback mechanisms.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add more interactivity to videos with overlays or captions.
- Optimize video loading further for slower connections.
